### アニ見る
#### Watch and track anime
An anime watching application inspired by Tachiyomi

Plans:
* Kitsu, AniList, and (eventually) MyAnimeList tracking support
  * Unified Plan to Watch list
  * Merge like entries (and unmerge, just in case)
* Extensible provider support, two providers planned for initial release
  * Search for anime by name
* Pair anime from streaming sites to anime from tracking sites
* Either stream or download
  * Open stream in app (VLC, etc)
  * Download video, and open in app
* LONG SHOT: Advanced Anime Search within app itself
* Who knows? Open up an issue with a request and I'll see if it is within the realm of what I/we think this app can and should be
